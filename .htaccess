# Define the base URL relative to the DocumentRoot of your Apache server
# In XAMPP, this is often /var/www/html or C:/xampp/htdocs
# You need to specify the path *from* the Apache DocumentRoot *to* your application folder.
# For http://localhost:8080/namaste-resources/, the RewriteBase should be /namaste-resources/
RewriteBase /namastepavilion/

# 1. Internally rewrite extensionless URLs to include .php
#    This rule checks if a file with the requested name plus a .php extension exists
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}.php -f
#    If it does, internally rewrite the URL to include .php
#    The ^([^/.]+)$ matches paths like 'about', 'contact', but not 'css/style.css' or 'image.png'
RewriteRule ^([^/.]+)$ $1.php [L]

# 2. OPTIONAL: Redirect old .php URLs to new extensionless URLs (SEO friendly)
#    This prevents duplicate content issues and redirects users/search engines who have old links.
#    It's particularly useful if your site was previously accessed with .php extensions.
#    This condition ensures we only process requests that explicitly have .php in them
RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} ^[A-Z]{3,}\s([^.]+)\.php\sHTTP/ [NC]
#    This rule captures the part before .php and redirects to it
#    R=301: Permanent redirect (good for SEO)
#    L: Last rule, stop processing further rules
RewriteRule ^([^.]+)\.php$ $1 [R=301,L]

# 3. Handle specific index.php case (important for root of your subdirectory)
#    If someone accesses http://localhost:8080/namaste-resources/, this ensures
#    it doesn't redirect from index.php to just nothing.
RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} ^[A-Z]{3,}\s/namastepavilion/index\.php\sHTTP/ [NC]
RewriteRule ^index\.php$ /namastepavilion/ [R=301,L]
